# TrebleTracksWWDC2023


## About 

A side project of mine that was submitted to the WWDC 2023 Student Challenge competition.

It's a simple Mac Catalyst app that teaches people the very basics of reading sheet music. 

I utilized Apple's SwiftUI and AVFoundation framework to create the app. I also did a bit of async programming magic to ensure the animations are smoothly played with the correct sound timings.

## How to run

Just simply clone this repo, open in XCode, set the target to Mac Catalyst and run!
